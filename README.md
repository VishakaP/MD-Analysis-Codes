# MD Analysis Codes
This repository is used to deposit various MD analysis scripts developed to easy the life and to visualize them easily for research work

1. Distribution_of_displacement.ipynb [https://github.com/VishakaP/MD-Analysis-Codes/blob/main/Distribution_of_displacement.ipynb]
This file generates a graph showing the distribution of displacement for a selected ion or atom in an MD simulation. It is particularly useful when comparing systems with a bound ion (such as chloride) between a wild-type protein and its mutant. Using this notebook in my research, I observed that one protein exhibited a more loosely bound chloride ion as a result of the introduced mutations.
